# Coverage configuration
# We strive for 100% test coverage - current threshold prevents regression
# Note: Some code cannot be tested:
# - createServerSideContext requires Next.js runtime (cookies() from next/headers)
# - getSessionFromCookies in tmid session.ts requires Next.js runtime (cookies() from next/headers)
# - auth.switchOrg failure case requires race condition (session deleted between middleware and call)
# - xscenario/fscenario are test utilities that use test.skip/test.only
